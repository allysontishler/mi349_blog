      <h3>Who is Ally Tishler?</h3>
      <p>Hi! I’m Ally Tishler and I am a current undergraduate student at Michigan State University studying Information Science and Technology. I aspire to work in the UI/UX field in the future and to be able to apply my creativity in the tech world. Other than design tech, I also have strong interests in the fields of dermatology and skin care.</p>
      <h3>Ally's Skincare Background</h3>
      <p>I grew up in a Korean American household and with the rising popularity of Korean skin care in recent years, I thought I would share my experiences through this blog. Throughout my childhood, I had severe hormonal and genetic acne that caused my skin to break out in painful patterns. I tried many of the top recommended products and personalized formulas, but nothing seemed to make a lasting impact. Around my pre-teens, I delved into the world of Korean skincare and never looked back. I spent my days researching what to look for in products and what not to look for. All of this led to the strengthening, brightening, and improved health of my skin. I still have break outs here and there, but I’m still on my journey to finding the perfect routine for me. With this blog, I hope that you can achieve this too!</p>
      <p>For fun, here is my current skincare routine! For mornings I skip the oil cleanser and for nights I skip the sunscreen.</p>
